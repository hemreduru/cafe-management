# Cafe Management Project Rules

## Role Specifications

- **Roles Defined:**  
  - **Admin:**  
    - Has full permissions to manage users.  
    - Can view and generate all types of reports.  
  - **Employee:**  
    - Does not have access to user management or detailed reporting functionalities.
    
## System Requirements and Functional Rules

### General Requirements
- The project is a Cafe Management system.
- The system includes product management with full CRUD operations.
- Deleted products and users are soft-deleted (marked as inactive) and can be restored.
- The system is bilingual (English and Turkish) using Laravel's default localization.

### User and Product Management
- **Products:**  
  - CRUD operations must include soft delete and a restore mechanism.
  - Product pricing rules should enforce that the sales price is greater than or equal to the cost price.
- **Users:**  
  - Admin can create, update, or delete user accounts.
  - Self-registration is not allowed. Only an admin can create an account for an employee.

### Reporting
- **Sales and Profit Reporting:**  
  - Reports are provided for daily, weekly, monthly, and overall performance.
  - Reports must include both the number of products sold and the total profit calculated using product cost and sales price.
  - Access to detailed reports is restricted solely to admin users.

### Middleware & Authorization
- Implement role-based access control to ensure:
  - **Admin** can access all routes including user management and reporting.
  - **Employee** access is limited to specific parts of the system and cannot view reports or manage users.

### Logging, Error Handling, and Transactions
- All database operations must be wrapped in transactions.
- Utilize try-catch blocks in all DB interactions.
- Log every operation (create, update, delete, restore) including user information, date, and the nature of the operation.

### Theme and Styling
- Use the AdminLTE template without custom CSS modifications.
- Bootstrap styling is allowed.
- Ensure the interface supports dark mode.

### Localization
- The project must support both Turkish and English.
- Use Laravelâ€™s default localization files to manage language strings.

### Authentication
- The project starts with a basic login screen.
- No public registration allowed.  
- Use Laravel Breeze for authentication handling.

## Final Notes
- Follow these guidelines to ensure a clear separation of concerns between admin and employee functionalities.
- Adhere to best practices regarding security, logging, and error handling.
- Ensure all custom requests follow the validation logic and are well-documented for future maintenance.
